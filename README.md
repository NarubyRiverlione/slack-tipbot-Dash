How to Run a TipBot
-------------------
### Setup
 - Add a bot integration to Slack [here](https://my.slack.com/services/new/bot)
    - Make sure you copy the Slack API token

### Install
 - `git clone https://github.com/narubyriverlione/slack-tipbot`
 - `cd slack-tipbot`
 - `npm install`
 - create rates directory: 'mkdir tmp/rates'

### Run
Change the `YOUR_SLACK_TOKEN` in the below snippet to the API key.
```sh
DEBUG="tipbot:*" node bot.js \
  --slack-token="YOUR_SLACK_TOKEN" 
```

You can also use ENV variable instead of argument:
 - `TIPBOT_SLACK_TOKEN`

You should use something like [forever](https://www.npmjs.com/package/forever) or [supervisord](http://supervisord.org/) to keep it running on a server,
but using a `screen` does the job too xD

### Usage
You can control / communicate with the tipbot by sending the bot a **direct message** or **mentioning** its name in a channel.
The tipbot responds to certain 'trigger words' in a sentence, so you can wrap the trigger word in a nice looking sentence and it will work.

For example, to trigger the `help` command you can could say `hey @tipbot can you help me figure out how tipping works`
and the `help` in that sentence will trigger displaying the help information.

#### Commands / Trigger words
##### `help` - *ask the bot for help*
eg; `hey @tipbot can you show me the help info!`

##### `balance` - *ask the bot for your current balance*
eg; `hey @tipbot can you please tell me my balance`

##### `send <value + unit> @someone` - *tell the bot to send coins to someone*
eg; `@tipbot please send 0.1 GRC to @bob` will send 0.1 GRC to @bob.

the `<value + unit>` can be `0.1 GRC` or `10000000 Satoshi`

this command has a few aliases which you can use; `give` and `sent`
eg; `@tipbot can you give @bob 0.1 GRC` or `@tipbot I'd like you to send @bob 0.1 GRC`

##### `deposit` - *ask the bot for a deposit address*
eg; `@tipbot I'd like to deposit some GRC`

##### `withdraw` -  *tell the bot you want to withdraw to an address*
eg; `@tipbot I want to withdraw 0.5 GRC to 1dice8EMZmqKvrGE4Qc9bUFf9PX3xaYDp`

after you've requested the withdraw the bot will confirm with you if it's OK, replying with `yes`, `ok` or `sure` will make the transaction happen.

#### Channels
By default the tipbot joins the default `#general` channel, you can invite him into other channels just like you invite normal users into channels.


Security / Privacy
------------------
The tipbot is in full control of the coins.

When you invite the tipbot into a channel it can see all the messages in the channel,
keep this in mind if the tipbot is hosted by that one intern that has left your company for a competitor ;-)

- ​*currencies*​  ask the bot for a list of supported currencies; ​_@tipbot currencies PLX!_​ 
- ​*price*​      ask the bot for the GRC price in a particular currency; ​_@tipbot price in USD!_​ 
- ​*convert*​    ask the bot to convert between a particular currency and GRC (or visa versa); ​_@tipbot 1 USD to EUR!_​  or; ​_@tipbot 0.03 GRC to GBP_​
- ​*receive* <value + unit> @someone​  tell the bot to request coins from someone.  `@tipbot I want to receive 0.1 GRC from @bob` will request 0.1 GRC from @bob. After you've requested coins from someone that person will be asked if that is OK, replying with `yes`, `ok` or `sure` will make the transaction happen. The `<value + unit>` can be `0.1 GRC` or `10000000 Satoshi`  This command has a few aliases which you can use; `ask`, `demand`, `deserve`, `send me`, `give me`, `gimme` and `owes me` eg; `@tipbot I demand 0.1 GRC from @bob for making such a cool bot` or `@tipbot @bob please gimme 0.1 GRC for lunch`
